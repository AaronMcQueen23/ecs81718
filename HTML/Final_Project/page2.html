        I have been to three basketball camps and have been apart of two allstar games to show off my basketball skills. The basketball camps that I have been to were FIVE STAR basketball camp, Prep Hoops camp and CrossRoads Elite camp, a camp that I was invited to to play against some top players in the 2020 and 2021 class. The allstar games that I have
    been apart of were the FIVE STAR allstar game. There were 91 kids at the camp and I was able to be one of the eighteen players selected for the alllstar game.
    The other allstar game was the Chicago United future stars allstar game. I was able to play at a college universty court in front of a large group of people

    <p1> At the Five Star camp we played about 4 or more games. I was able to average about 11 points per game. One of my games I was able to score 18. I was so excited and amazed to hear my name being called to be part 
    of the Allstar game. It was my first time being selected for one.
    My other camp was Prep Hoops camp. That camp had 6 points camp. The camp was for 2020 and 2021 players of Illinois to compete against one another. It was good to compete and get ready for the highschool basketball season.
    CrossRoads Elite camp was an ESPN camp that I was invited to compete against other top players in my class and the 2020 class. I also averaged 6 points at that camp. My highest was 12 points. The camp had very good exposure and helped me see how I can
    work on my basketball game to become a better baketball player, make my self a known player, get college scholarships and to make on the ESPN Top 100 list.

 <p2> At the Five Star Camp I was able to be selected into the Allstar game. Before that we had scrimmage games with your teams and the top two or three best players on your team got selected for the Allstar game. Because I was doind so
 great at the camp I was able to participate in Allstar game. I was so excited because only eighteen out of 91 kids got selected for the allstar game. The Chicago united was another allstar game that I was excited to be apart of. We got our own jerseys to keep and were able to play in front of a large crowd of people.
  It was also my first time playing basketball infront of a large group of people and playing with and against Chicagos best 2021 group.</p2>
