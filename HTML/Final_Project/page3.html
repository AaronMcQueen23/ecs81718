    <p>The NY2LA is a basketball tournament that features a lot og great teams in the midwest area. It takes place in Milwaukee Wisconsin.
    The tournament is very competitive. At the NY2LA tournament I was able to average 15 points per game. One game I had 25 points which also included 
    a buzzer beater to win the game for my team. At the NY2LA tournaments I was able to get write-ups about me. Which said "Aaron McQueen — 2021 — PF — All In Athletics Figueroa
A long, rangy interior player, McQueen brings activity to the court and has the ability to impact a game with an offensive rebound, blocked shot or an easy lay-up in transition. Also showed the ability to step out and hit a mid-range shot or two."
 Another right up about me said "Aaron McQueen — 2021 — F — All In Athletics
An athletic looking kid, McQueen is an active big man at both ends of the court and also shows the ability to create his own offense a little, especially facing up at the high post. Has a smooth looking shot out to 15 feet and can handle the ball a little."
I also got three tweets from NY2LA about how many points I scored in my teams win. They said "8th GRADE FINAL-ALL IN ATHLETICS FIGUEROA 48 MERCURY EILTE 40-AARON MCQUEEN 15 PTS." Session 2 Final - 8th Grade - All In Figueroa 52 Team Ramey Black 39 - Aaron McQueen 15 pts." 
The last tweet said "Session 2 Final - 8th Grade - All In Figueroa 66 IL Irish 65 - Aaron McQueen 25 points." 
I am very excited to compete in this upcoming NY2LA
tournaments because I  am hoping to get more tweets, write-ups and to try to win the tournament to bring some hardware back home in Chicago. Off course it would be tuff because I am playing against some of the best players in the
midwest area. This year I just I have to play my game and hope for the best. </p>
